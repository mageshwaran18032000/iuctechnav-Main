               Embedding a google map offers your visitors a lot of benefits. Just another day at Googleplex, Mountain View. It helps customers get directions. By adding a map on your site, it saves customers the steps of opening maps in another window and copying over the address.Local Search Engines could use these HTML snippets for all of the locations and allow users to plan their day by browsing and saving the relevant locations that appeared in the search result, on to the google maps app which could be used later while spending the day. I just searched one of the location on JustDial.com on my desktop and, went to a restaurant where address also consisted of Google Maps Icon. While accessing the location on google map, I was able to imagine the benefit if I would have been able to âSaveâ and later access this location from my mobile phone. No more hassles of noting the address and the searching it later on mobile device.

               With the nature of Googleâs business being search and the fact that more than 90% of online journeys start with the use of a search engine, it should come as no surprise that the various search engines provide their own local business listings. Google refers to its local business listing platform as Google My Business. The resulting Google My Business listings include a businessâ name, address, phone number and website. This business listing information is available through a variety of Google properties â including Google Maps. In fact, Google My Business offers everything you need for a potential customer to find and use your services, buy your products or visit your business. Once youâve registered or claimed your local business listing via the Google My Business dashboard, you can respond to customer reviews and add images to help your business stand out.
